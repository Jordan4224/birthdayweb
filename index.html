        Happy Birthday beautiful😘                  discipline and kind heart are so admirable. I'm so 
                                                    lucky I get to witness you make your mark in this
                                                    world. Happy Birthday my littlest bear. I love you!!      

        Sean - Today, I hope you take the time      Janpol - Mo, I remember Jose telling me, Philly and Aaron his “little” brother was 
        to reflect on how much you mean to us       coming to school. We were all joking saying we were gonna bully you because you were 
        as a family. Your presence impacts us       the “little” brother and then when we saw you😭you were HUGE bigger than Jose was.     
        all and we’re so grateful to have you       It was a fun memory because you were shy but quickly fit in our group and just as 
        in our lives. Happy birthday, Moises        quickly became one of my best friends. I remember us constantly hoping on Apex and
                                                    just grinding and talking late at night until 3 in the morning just trying to reach 
                                                    Plat. You remember when we were doing Duos in Olympus and just touching people 
                                                    getting 4 kills each and over 1k of damage and us dying because I couldn’t clutch up? 
                                                    It just kept being us rushing and dying and you screaming “Your so ass it was so low”😂
                                                    You remember us being in our group and everytime Jordan would talk we would just tell 
                                                    him to stfu? Or that time we all made alternate accounts to help him level up just 
                                                    for him to say he doesn’t need our help and end up only getting gold?🤣. I still 
                                                    can’t believe how you quickly became one of the most challenging people I have 
                                                    ever met you truly did make all the games we played fun and really push me. And how 
                                                    much you ended becoming one of my best friends.
        Janpol(for Moises and Jose) - Jose and Mo 
        you guys truly became one of my brothers 
        because of the stuff we been through and I
        can’t thank you guys enough for the 
        friendship and memories. Have an amazing 
        bday and ik I won’t be there to celebrate 
        but the moment you guys come to LA we 
        will CELEBRATE LIKE KINGS😝
